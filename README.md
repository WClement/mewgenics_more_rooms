Basic mod for adding more rooms. Simply uncommented some extra basement rooms that were left in the base game and made their upgrade path from Frank available. Goes in mewtator mods folder.


- Uncommented existing basement upgrade path from frank
- Reduced upgrade cost to 2 for basements
- moved basement rooms xy positions up
- moved attic up to accomodate new rooms
- So far the game has saved cats and furniture in the rooms as normal

todos and bugs:
- rooms have blank backgrounds
- room positioning is off
- "Depart!" sign button covers adventure box due to zooming out more.
- .merge files have excess redundant info from original unpack.
