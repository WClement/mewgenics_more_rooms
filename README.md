Basic mod for adding more rooms. Simply uncommented some extra basement rooms that were left in the base game and made their upgrade path from Frank available. Goes in mewtator mods folder.

NOTE: the house does not dynamically resize. Once you have house3 (three floors tall) there will be blank space between floor two and the attic for the future "basement" rooms that you will unlock.

- Uncommented existing basement upgrade path from frank
- Reduced upgrade cost to 2 for basements
- moved basement rooms xy positions up
- moved attic up to accomodate new rooms
- So far the game has saved cats and furniture in the rooms as normal

todos and bugs:
- roof of house is visually overlapping the first new "basement" room.
- rooms have blank backgrounds.
- "Depart!" sign button covers adventure box due to zooming out more.
- .merge files have excess redundant info from original unpack.
